1:  16/04   07:00   07:15   Introduction    Read task, setup folders and
                                            file organisation.

2:  16/04   07:15   08:00   Coding          First attempt at Part 1   

3:  16/04   08:00   08:25   Testing & Debug After many errors, the 
                                            program now works properly
                                            whilst running my own tests.

4:  16/04   08:30   08:35   Dryrun & Tweaks Tests showed issue in code -                                            
                                            Need to modify to terminate 
                                            only when there is no 
                                            further input.

5:  16/04   08:45   09:15   Passed Dryrun   After much tweaking, the 
                                            program now passes it's 
                                            dryrun test. It will be 
                                            tidied and refined as the 
                                            project continues.

6:  25/04   11:40   11:55   Begin Part 2    Just getting the printf 
                                            functions and other code
                                            shared with Part 1 to work

7:  25/04   11:55   12:20   Coding          Actually make the program 
                                            convert Roman numerals to 
                                            decimal

8:  25/04   01:15   02:20   Coding          Continue from before

9:  25/04   02:20   02:45   Research        Having written code to 
                                            convert roman numerals into
                                            decimal (untested), I am 
                                            researching methods to 
                                            identify illegal numerals
                                            (e.g. IVI != 6). I have come
                                            across an idea to do a back
                                            conversion (i.e. run it 
                                            through part 1) and compare.

                                            I can easily get rid of 
                                            spaces and differences in 
                                            case using lab07 code.

10: 25/04   03:00   04:30    Coding          I've implemented all of the
                                            code for the Advanced part, 
                                            but still have not tested - 
                                            poor practice I know 

11: 25/04   08:00   10:30   Debugging       Program compiles perfectly 
                                            in GCC, works partially in
                                            DCC and breaks entirely in 
                                            VCC. After many attempts and
                                            much research I am no closer
                                            to a solution. On the plus
                                            side the actual conversion
                                            of roman numeral to decimal 
                                            is perfect, including the 
                                            'Advanced' conditions.

                                            I shall revisit in a few 
                                            days. Any more self-harm 
                                            would be tantamount to 
                                            suicide. 

12: 25/04   10:30   11:30   Dryrun Fix      So I couldn't wait. I found 
                                            and fixed the problem 
                                            (string length problems), 
                                            I now just need to clean up 
                                            both programs. I'll try to 
                                            make them more consistent
                                            with one another. I may also
                                            look at utilising functions
                                            - we'll see how workload is

13: 26/04   11:30   12:30   Cleanup         Just tidying the code on 
                                            both programs, getting rid 
                                            of redundant variables and 
                                            such.

14: 26/04   01:30   02:30   Functions       I've broken off a large part
                                            of the RtoD code into its 
                                            own function, it's not 
                                            necessarily easier to read
                                            but at least it demonstrates
                                            knowledge of functions and 
                                            make me violate that 72
                                            width limit a bit less
                                            
15  30/04   07:30   07:45   Tweaking        Just condensed a bit of code
                                            following something covered
                                            in yesterday's lab.

                                            The assignment is currently 
                                            ready for submission.
