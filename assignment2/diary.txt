1:  01/06   17:00   17:20   Setup           Read task, setup folders and
                                            file organisation. I also sorted
                                            the source file, putting in headers
                                            and function prototypes.

2:  01/06   17:40   18:20   Coding          Began coding of readBoard and 
                                            printBoard as per assignment hints. 

3:  01/06   19:15   20:00   Coding          Continue from before. Trying to 
                                            finish readBoard and printBoard. 

4:  01/06   20:00   20:45   Debugging       Have been running 2048 through GCC
                                            and the first two dryruns. Have had
                                            some issues with getting printBoard
                                            right, but nothing too difficult.
                                            I've also written the function
                                            boardContains2048 so that I can get
                                            those dryruns correct.

5:  01/16   21:00   21:30   Coding          Now that those three functions are
                                            working nicely, I'll start working
                                            on the moveXXXX functions. I don't 
                                            think they'll be too hard - just
                                            more loops. gameOver may be hard.

6:  01/16   21:30   22:10   Coding          I've got moveRight adding numbers
                                            correctly, but I forgot about having
                                            it shift everything as far right as
                                            possible (basically overriding 0s).

                                            Return values are correct.

                                            I've finalised moveRight and tested
                                            it, and I've also written and tested
                                            moveLeft. Now onto moveUp and Down.

7:  01/16   22:10   23:00   Coding          I found some issues with moveRight
                                            and the others (wasn't shifting 
                                            after addition), but with that fixed
                                            I've been able to complete all 
                                            different moveXXXX functions. 

8:  01/06   23:00   23:45   Coding          I've written the gameOver function - 
                                            it was relatively simple, I 
                                            duplicated the board and ran all 
                                            moveXXXX functions against it.

                                            After some miscellaneous debugging,
                                            I've run the dryrun and passed all
                                            32 tests. Very happy - and in only 6
                                            hours!

9:  02/06   00:15   xx:xx   Cleanup         I'v begun now working on tidying up 
                                            the program - making sure nothing
                                            exceeds 80 columns, removing 
                                            redundant code and such.

                                            I have noticed, but will not edit - 
                                            there are two lines of code in main
                                            (both printf functions) that exceed
                                            80 columns.
